* Gate controller

Open my gate and garage using an ESP8266 connected to an old IR remote controller.
The web server is exposed on the internet using YDNS, the IP is kept up to date by the ESP8266 itself.

** Newlines stripping in the HTML

To put the HTML source in the [[src/HTML.h][C code]] as string it's convenient to strip the ~\n~ characters.

#+begin_src shell
cat index.html | tr -d '\n'
#+end_src

** Secrets

The file [[src/Secrets.h]] is needed.

#+begin_src shell
#define WIFI_ESSID ""
#define WIFI_PASSWORD ""

#define HTTP_USER ""
#define HTTP_PASSWORD ""

#define YDNS_USER ""
#define YDNS_PASSWORD ""
#define YDNS_HOST ""
#+end_src
